I am a software engineer focusing on language design and distributed systems. At Interautomation GmbH I develop passenger counting and passenger information systems. My goal is to support open-source and free software projects. To learn more, take a look at [Cuneiform](joergen7/cuneiform), a distributed functional programming language, or [gen_pnet](joergen7/gen_pnet), an Erlang library to implement Petri nets.

Professionally, I program C, C++, Java, and Python. For my own projects, I prefer Erlang, Common Lisp, or Racket.
