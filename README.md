I am a software engineer in language design and distributed systems. Professionally, I maintain passenger counting and passenger information systems for Interautomation GmbH. I build up and support several open-source and free software projects. These include Cuneiform, a distributed functional programming language I designed, and gen_pnet, an Erlang library to implement Petri nets.
