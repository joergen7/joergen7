I am a software engineer in language design and distributed systems. I maintain passenger counting and passenger information systems at Interautomation GmbH. I build up and support several open-source and free software projects. E.g., Cuneiform, a distributed functional programming language, and gen_pnet, an Erlang library to implement Petri nets.
